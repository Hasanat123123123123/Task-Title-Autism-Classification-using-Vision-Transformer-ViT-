# Task-Title-Autism-Classification-using-Vision-Transformer-ViT-

Task Description: We will perform classification on an autism-related
dataset using the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The goal is to classify
images into two categories: "Austim" and "No_Austim". The dataset
consists of images for training, validation, and testing. You will use the ViT
model pre-trained on ImageNet to extract features from the images. The
extracted features are then passed through a linear classifier for binary
classification. The code should use PyTorch Lightning or HF trainer for
training, validation, and test loops, as well as logging with TensorBoard or
WanDB and model checkpointing.
